		<p> In Plato’s Symposium, Diotima shares with Socrates a progression of love by which one can eventually see the final visions of life’s mysteries. According to Diotima, man’s understanding of love begins with infatuation or love of a particular body, moves into loving the soul and discourse produced by that body, then extends into the rest of the world as one begins to love beautiful minds and finally the knowledge itself that manifests within them. Within each individual relationship, this progression materializes from the initial moment of attraction that draws us together through the unfolding friendship and independence that sustains happy marriages long after bodies have become raisins left to dry on the first rung of Diotima’s ladder. </p>

		<p> These photographs aim to show the progression of vulnerability as a young relationship begins. Through bodies as divine instruments of the worldly love Plato describes, strangers slowly reveal themselves and become comfortable in increasing mutual honesty.  The internal vantage point invites viewers into intimate moments as if they're involved, provoking empathy and allowing external associations and experiences into an otherwise private relationship. Experiencing stories through other people often provides the best canvas to understand ourselves better through the emotional responses that arrive as we empathize. </p>

		<p>As I understand it so far, all art is about love.</p>
		
		<h5>
		<blockquote>The will to create is fundamentally out of love -- to make something and give it to the world is ultimate devotion to that which provokes us as creators. </blockquote>
		</h5>
    	
    	<p>As such, vulnerability, the opportunity to be honest about ourselves, is the birthplace of creativity and essence of human life. Love throughout all rungs of Diotima’s progression provides different perspectives for us to examine vulnerability as it relates to understanding ourselves and others, and it is only through understanding and willingness to explore love that we can explore our own individual capacity for creation. </p>

		<p>Contemporary poet (and beloved inspiration of mine) Claire Schwartz recently tweeted “I love how love is a vector, how loving someone recommits me to learning to love better.” As I continue to navigate my own role in this relationship, I’m realizing that learning to love someone has everything to do with learning to love myself and the world around me. I’m learning that when I am loving someone or something, it is really to say that the immediate object of my affection inspires love in me, which transcends the relationship and commits me to the nature of love for everything else that surrounds me. Beyond capturing and sharing the moments that have provoked so much exciting consideration in my own life, these photographs aim to harness visual manifestations of Plato’s greater worldly love surrounding us all, using the relationship as an exploratory space for the vulnerable reflection that keeps us alive and making.
